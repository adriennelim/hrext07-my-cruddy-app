# hrext07-my-cruddy-app
Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

## Tasks
my cruddy tic-tac-toe game

### Input: 
- Player 1 & Player 2 names
- First player gets to pick symbol (X or O)
- Tic-Tac-Toe game board

### Output:
- Game outcomes: Announce winner or a draw if it's a draw
- Scoreboard: Keep a record of game outcomes (localStorage)
    - e.g. Adrienne vs Merlin: Merlin wins! date&timeStamp
    - e.g. Stephen vs Merlin: It's a draw! date&timeStamp

### UI/UX Considerations:
- Game Mode: Player 1 and 2 would take turns to play
- Game Mode: Ends when all 9 boxes are filled
- Game Mode: Can hit reset button any time
- Game Mode: Can pause game and replay
- Scoreboard: User can delete entries (Stretch goal - incorporate password!)
- Ongoing games list: user can click on game and resume


### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to capture data? (input box)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)

### Stretch goals!
- [ ] Play against the computer
- [ ] Play with another user on a different computer
